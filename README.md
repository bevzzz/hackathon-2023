# Ganymede Cookbook

A Next.js project for tracking price changes of your favorite dishes and recepies.
Start by adding some recipies, then find the best value propositions for the ingredients in the main Austrian supermarket chains.

This app was made possible thanks to [badlogic](https://github.com/badlogic) and the data that they collect and update on a daily basis.
